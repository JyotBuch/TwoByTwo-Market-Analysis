# TwoByTwo Learning Center: Childcare Needs Assessment

## Project Overview
The **TwoByTwo Learning Center** aims to address the lack of extended childcare services in the Champaign-Urbana area. Most daycare centers operate only until **6 PM**, creating challenges for families with non-traditional work schedules. This project involves conducting a structured **survey** to understand the demand for extended childcare hours and assess the potential benefits to the community.

## Problem Statement
While numerous daycare services exist in the **Champaign-Urbana area**, none offer childcare beyond **6 PM**, despite a significant portion of families working in professions with **non-regular hours** (e.g., hospitals, police stations, fire stations). The lack of flexible childcare options forces parents to resort to expensive, unreliable alternatives or make career sacrifices.

The **TwoByTwo Learning Center** plans to implement extended childcare services, but there is insufficient data to determine whether this aligns with community needs. The primary objective of this project is to **collect and analyze data** to guide strategic decision-making.

## Objectives
- **Assess the Demand:** Understand the need for childcare services beyond **6 PM**.
- **Identify Challenges:** Determine key challenges families face with existing daycare options.
- **Measure Impact:** Evaluate whether extended childcare hours provide meaningful benefits to families.
- **Guide Decision-Making:** Provide data-driven insights to help the TwoByTwo Learning Center optimize its service offerings.

## Methodology
1. **Survey Design:** Develop a structured survey to collect responses from local families and organizations.
2. **Data Collection:** Distribute the survey through various community channels (e.g., schools, workplaces, social media).
3. **Data Cleaning & Analysis:** Process and analyze responses to identify trends and key insights.
4. **Visualization & Reporting:** Create reports and visualizations to communicate findings effectively.
5. **Strategic Recommendations:** Provide actionable insights to support TwoByTwo Learning Center's decision-making process.

## Deliverables
- **Survey Questionnaire:** Structured questionnaire for data collection.
- **Clean Dataset:** Organized and processed survey responses.
- **Analysis Report:** Summary of findings with statistical insights.
- **Data Visualizations:** Graphical representation of key trends.
- **Strategic Recommendations:** Insights for the TwoByTwo Learning Center to refine its service model.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Survey Tools:** Google Forms, Qualtrics, or Typeform
- **Data Analysis:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib), R
- **Visualization:** Power BI, Tableau, or Python (Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- **Report Generation:** Jupyter Notebook, Markdown, or LaTeX

## Expected Impact
- Help working parents access **reliable and affordable extended childcare** services.
- Support local businesses and organizations by improving employee work-life balance.
- Enable the **TwoByTwo Learning Center** to make informed business decisions based on real data.
